[Quick zoom in on her face]
2. Intro Unit
Lighthearted Humor Frame
Example Script: [Emma making coffee, spilling it slightly]

[Cuts to Emma sipping coffee dramatically]
Emma: "Anyway, today we're going to attempt to be productive. Emphasis on attempt."
Goal Statement Frame
Example Script: [Emma holding up a ridiculously long to-do list]
Emma: "So here's the plan. I need to clean my entire apartment, answer approximately 4,000 emails, edit a video, go to the gym, and meal prep for the week. Totally reasonable for someone who just spent 20 minutes deciding which mug to use, right?"
3. Content Journey Unit
Relatable Moment Frame
Example Script: [Emma staring at her laptop, looking overwhelmed]
Emma: "Does anyone else just stare at their inbox sometimes and feel their soul leaving their body? No? Just me? Cool."
[Emma dramatically slumps in chair]

Unfiltered Confession Frame
Example Script: [Emma sitting on floor of messy closet]
Emma: "Okay so I was supposed to be cleaning but then I found this sweater I forgot I had and then I started trying on outfits and now it's been an hour and my room is actually messier than when I started. This is why I can't have nice things, including a productive day."
[Pans to show even messier room]
Emma: "I wish I could say this is unusual behavior for me but... we all know that would be a lie."
4. Rehook Unit
Humor Rehook Frame
Example Script: [Emma in workout clothes, lying on yoga mat]
Emma: "Plot twist! I made it to the at-home workout portion of my day. Second plot twist! I've been lying here scrolling through TikTok for 15 minutes instead of actually working out. This is what we call ✨multitasking✨."
[Emma does one half-hearted sit-up]
Emma: "Fitness influencer in the making, clearly."
5. Escalation Unit
Unexpected Obstacle Frame
Example Script: [Emma looking at clock, panicked]
Emma: "It's already 4 PM?! How?! Time is literally a social construct designed to make me feel bad about myself."
[Quick cuts of Emma rushing around]
Emma: "New plan. We're going to prioritize. And by prioritize, I mean do the bare minimum and pretend the rest wasn't important anyway."
Self-Deprecating Humor Frame
Example Script: [Emma attempting to meal prep, making a mess]
Emma: "Gordon Ramsay is definitely somewhere right now having a stress response and he doesn't even know why. It's because of whatever this is that I'm creating."

Acceptance Frame
Example Script: [Emma on couch, looking tired but content]

[Emma looks at list, then tosses it over her shoulder]
Emma: "Close enough."
7. Outro Unit
Reflection with Humor Frame
Example Script: [Emma in bed again, now in pajamas]
Emma: "So today I learned that I'm still terrible at being productive, but I'm really good at convincing myself that scrolling through social media counts as 'research' and that organizing my Spotify playlists is 'essential life admin.'"
[Emma laughs]
Emma: "But honestly, I did more today than yesterday, so... growth? Maybe the real productivity was the mental breakdowns we had along the way."
Casual Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Emma getting under covers]
Emma: "Anyway, let me know in the comments what you do when you're procrastinating. Make me feel better about myself, please and thank you. I'm going to sleep now and tomorrow I'll probably make another unrealistic to-do list because I never learn. Goodnight!"
[Peace sign to camera, then reaches to turn it off]
Production Notes:

1. Hook Unit
Call Out the Audience Frame
Example Script: [Gary speaking directly to camera, energetic, gesturing]
Gary: "Entrepreneurs! Listen up! If you're putting in work but not seeing results, this is for you. The next 60 seconds might be the most important minute for your business this year."
[Quick zoom in]
Gary: "I'm about to tell you exactly why you're spinning your wheels."
2. Problem Setup Unit
Relatable Problem Frame
Example Script: [Gary walking through office, talking to camera]
Gary: "Every day I talk to entrepreneurs who are working 12-hour days, posting content, sending emails, making calls, and they're frustrated because they're not seeing traction. They're doing the work but the results aren't there. Sound familiar?"
[Points at camera]
Gary: "I get it. I've been there. But here's what you're missing."
Myth-Buster Frame
Example Script: [Gary stops walking, serious expression]
Gary: "Here's the truth nobody wants to tell you: working hard means nothing if you're working on the wrong things. Nothing! You could be the hardest worker in the room and still fail if you're focused on stuff that doesn't matter."
[Emphatic hand gesture]
Gary: "Your social media aesthetic doesn't matter. Your perfect logo doesn't matter. Your business cards don't matter. What matters is creating value and getting it in front of customers. Period."
3. Content Delivery Unit
Teach a Concept Frame
Example Script: [Gary drawing simple diagram on whiteboard]
Gary: "Here's what actually moves the needle: One, customer acquisition - how you get people's attention. Two, conversion - how you turn that attention into sales. Three, retention - how you keep customers coming back. That's it!"
[Circles the three points aggressively]
Gary: "Everything else is just noise. If what you're doing doesn't directly impact one of these three things, you're wasting your time."
Success Formula Frame
Example Script: [Gary counting on fingers, intense energy]
Gary: "So here's your new game plan: Spend 33% of your time creating content that provides real value to your target customer. Spend 33% of your time distributing that content where your customers actually are. And spend 33% of your time directly engaging with potential and current customers."
[Pauses]
Gary: "And that last 1%? Use it to remind yourself that overnight success takes a decade!"
4. Rehook Unit
Question Rehook Frame
Example Script: [Gary leaning in closer to camera]
Gary: "But let me ask you something - are you actually willing to do this? Because most people will nod along, then go right back to wasting time on stuff that feels productive but doesn't drive results. Are you different? Are you actually committed to building something real?"
5. Practical Application Unit
Quick Win Frame
Example Script: [Gary sitting down, slightly calmer but still intense]
Gary: "Here's something you can do literally today: Audit your last week. Write down everything you did in your business, then mark each activity as either 'acquisition,' 'conversion,' or 'retention.' If most of your activities don't fit into those categories, you've identified your problem."
[Taps table for emphasis]
Gary: "Then, cancel one meeting this week that doesn't directly impact those areas and use that time to actually talk to a customer instead. Just watch what happens."
Common Pitfalls Frame
Example Script: [Gary shaking head, looking disappointed]
Gary: "And please, for the love of entrepreneurship, stop hiding behind busy work! Stop telling yourself that your website needs to be perfect before you launch. Stop waiting for the 'right time' to reach out to that big client. Stop consuming content instead of creating it. These are all forms of fear disguised as strategy, and they're killing your business."
6. Motivation Unit
Empathy Builder Frame
Example Script: [Gary's tone becomes slightly more compassionate]
Gary: "Look, I get it. This game is hard. Building something from nothing is supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it. You're going to have days where you question everything. I still have those days! But that's when you need to focus on actions that actually move the needle."
One-Liner Wisdom Frame
Example Script: [Gary points directly at camera]
Gary: "Remember this: The market doesn't care about your effort. It only cares about the value you create. So create value, distribute it at scale, and be patient. That's the game."
7. Outro Unit
Take Action Now Frame
Example Script: [Gary standing, high energy again]
Gary: "Now close this video and go do something that actually matters for your business. Right now! Not after another video, not tomorrow. Right. Now. Your future self will thank you."
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Gary smiling]
Gary: "If this helped you, share it with another entrepreneur who needs to hear it. And let me know in the comments what you're going to stop doing and start doing instead. I read every comment. Let's go!"

Constantly moving camera following Gary

Content Type: Tech Review
Theme Example: "The Future of Smartphones: [New Phone] Review"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Promise of Value Frame
Example Script: [Clean shot of phone on minimalist background, rotating slowly]
Marques: "This is the new [Phone Model], and it might just represent the future of smartphones. But not for the reasons you might think."
[MKBHD intro animation]
2. Intro Unit
Context Setting Frame
Example Script: [Marques at desk with phone in hand]
Marques: "I've been using the [Phone Model] as my daily driver for the past two weeks, and it's clear that [Company] is taking a different approach this year. Instead of just bumping specs, they're rethinking how we interact with our devices."
[B-roll of phone being used in various settings]
Overview Frame
Example Script: [Clean desk setup with phone and comparison devices]
Marques: "Before we dive deep, here's what you need to know: The [Phone Model] starts at $999 for the base model with 128GB of storage. It has a new [Processor], a redesigned camera system, and [Company]'s new AI features built in. But specs only tell part of the story."
3. Content Segment 1 Unit
Stat Drop Frame
Example Script: [Close-up of phone with specs appearing as text overlays]
Marques: "Let's talk performance. The new [Processor] is showing about a 20% improvement in benchmarks over last year's model, but more importantly, it's 30% more efficient. That translates to about 2 hours of additional battery life in my testing."
[Graph showing benchmark comparisons]
Comparison Frame
Example Script: [Split screen showing new phone next to competitors]
Marques: "Compared to the competition, the [Phone Model] is trading blows with [Competitor] in raw performance, but pulling ahead in sustained performance thanks to its improved thermal system. No throttling even after 30 minutes of gaming."
[Thermal camera footage showing heat distribution]
4. Rehook Unit
Big Reveal Frame
Example Script: [Marques holding phone, looking impressed]
Marques: "But here's where things get interesting. The feature that's actually changing how I use this phone isn't the processor or the display - it's something completely different that [Company] barely mentioned in their keynote."
[Close-up of specific feature]
5. Content Segment 2 Unit
Teach a Concept Frame
Example Script: [Marques demonstrating feature]
Marques: "The new [AI Feature] uses on-device machine learning to predict what you're trying to do and streamlines the process. For example, if I take a photo of a document, it automatically offers to scan, straighten, and save it to my files. No need to open a separate app or dig through menus."
[Demonstration of feature working seamlessly]
Behind-the-Scenes Frame
Example Script: [Technical explanation with simple graphics]
Marques: "What makes this possible is the dedicated neural engine in the new chip. It can perform up to 15 trillion operations per second while using minimal battery. That's how all this happens instantly without sending your data to the cloud."
[Animation showing how the technology works]
6. Content Segment 3 Unit
Common Pitfalls Frame
Example Script: [Marques looking slightly disappointed]
Marques: "It's not all perfect though. The [Feature X] that [Company] heavily promoted still feels half-baked. It works about 70% of the time in ideal conditions, but struggle with accents or in noisy environments. This definitely feels like a first-generation feature that needs refinement."
[Demonstration of feature failing]
Real-World Example Frame
Example Script: [Footage of phone being used in everyday situations]
Marques: "In day-to-day use, what I appreciate most is the improved battery life and camera. I can now confidently go a full day of heavy use without reaching for a charger, and the new main sensor captures noticeably better low-light photos."
[Side-by-side photo comparisons]
7. Conclusion Unit
Balanced Assessment Frame
Example Script: [Marques at desk with phone]
Marques: "So, is the [Phone Model] worth upgrading to? If you're coming from a phone that's two or more years old, absolutely. The performance improvements, battery life, and new AI features create a noticeably better experience. If you have last year's model, it's a tougher sell unless the specific new features address your pain points."
Future Perspective Frame
Example Script: [Thoughtful expression, wider shot of studio]
Marques: "What's most interesting to me is how this phone represents [Company]'s new direction. They're clearly focusing on making AI practical and useful rather than just a buzzword. This approach is likely to shape not just their future products, but how the entire industry thinks about integrating AI into our devices."
8. Outro Unit
Question for Audience Frame
Example Script: [Marques looking directly at camera]
Marques: "What do you think about this approach? Are practical AI features more valuable than raw specs? Let me know in the comments below."
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Standard outro position]
Marques: "If you enjoyed this video, be sure to hit that like button and subscribe for more tech reviews. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one."

1. Hook Unit
Intriguing Question Frame
Example Script: [Nas speaking energetically to camera, desert landscape behind him]
Nas: "What if I told you there's a country that has almost no fresh water, but is now exporting water to other countries? This is not science fiction. This is Singapore!"
[Text overlay: "NO WATER → WATER EXPORTER"]
2. Story Setup Unit
Context Setting Frame
Example Script: [Map graphic showing Singapore, quick cuts of city]
Nas: "Singapore is a tiny island nation with no natural lakes, no major rivers, and very little land to collect rainwater. By all logic, they should be in a permanent water crisis!"
[Text overlay: "SINGAPORE: 5.6 MILLION PEOPLE, ALMOST NO NATURAL WATER"]
Stakes Establishment Frame
Example Script: [Nas walking through urban area]
Nas: "For decades, Singapore had to import most of its water from neighboring Malaysia. This created a dangerous dependency. What if relations soured? What if Malaysia needed its own water? Singapore's very survival was at stake!"
[Text overlay: "WATER = SURVIVAL"]
3. Content Delivery Unit
Data Story Frame
Example Script: [Infographics appearing as Nas explains]
Nas: "In 1965, Singapore imported 80% of its water. Today? Just 40%. And by 2060, they plan to be completely self-sufficient! How did they do this? With something called the Four National Taps strategy."
[Animated graphic showing the reduction in water imports]
Teach a Concept Frame
Example Script: [Nas at water treatment facility]
Nas: "The Four National Taps are: One, water from Malaysia. Two, rainwater collection. Three, recycled water called NEWater. And four, desalinated seawater. But the real genius is in how they implemented these solutions!"
[Text overlay for each "tap" as Nas counts them]
4. Rehook Unit
Big Reveal Frame
Example Script: [Nas holding a bottle of clear water]
Nas: "This water I'm holding? It used to be sewage! Yes, SEWAGE! Singapore has perfected a technology that turns wastewater into ultra-clean drinking water. And it's so pure that it's used in manufacturing computer chips!"
[Text overlay: "FROM TOILET TO TAP"]
5. Deep Dive Unit
Behind-the-Scenes Frame
Example Script: [Nas touring facility with engineer]
Engineer: "Our NEWater goes through multiple barriers: microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection. It's actually cleaner than regular tap water."
Nas: "So you're saying this water is better than normal water?"
Engineer: "Scientifically speaking, yes!"
[Nas drinks the water, gives thumbs up]
Success Formula Frame
Example Script: [Nas walking along reservoir]
Nas: "But technology alone isn't enough. Singapore also implemented three other strategies: One, pricing water correctly to reflect its true cost. Two, creating a culture of conservation through education. And three, investing billions in research and infrastructure."
[Text overlay highlighting each point]
6. Human Element Unit
Personal Story Frame
Example Script: [Nas with local resident at home]
Resident: "When I was young, we had water rationing. Now, we have reliable water, but we still conserve it because we understand its value."
Nas: "So the mentality has changed?"
Resident: "Completely! Water conservation is part of our national identity now."
Counterintuitive Insight Frame
Example Script: [Nas at modern water innovation center]
Nas: "Here's what's fascinating: Singapore turned its biggest weakness into a strength! Today, Singapore exports water technology to over 100 countries and hosts the world's largest water technology gathering. Their water crisis created a multi-billion dollar industry!"
[Text overlay: "PROBLEM → OPPORTUNITY"]
7. Reflection Unit
Global Application Frame
Example Script: [Nas overlooking city skyline]
Nas: "With climate change making water scarcity a global issue, Singapore's solutions aren't just impressive—they're essential. Countries from Israel to Australia are now implementing similar strategies."
[Map showing countries adopting similar technologies]
One-Liner Wisdom Frame
Example Script: [Nas looking directly at camera]
Nas: "Singapore proves that with the right combination of technology, policy, and culture, even the most impossible resource challenges can be solved!"
[Text overlay: "IMPOSSIBLE → POSSIBLE"]
8. Outro Unit
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Nas energetic, signature pointing gesture]

[Text overlay: "5 VIRAL HACKS: TESTED"]
3. Content Segment 1 Unit
Demonstration Frame
Example Script: [Close-up of Nikkie with foundation and a fork]
Nikkie: "Hack number one: using a fork to apply foundation for an airbrushed finish. Apparently, the gaps in the fork are supposed to create the perfect amount of product distribution. This looks ridiculous, but let's try it!"
[Nikkie dips fork in foundation and begins applying]
Nikkie: "Oh my goodness, this feels so strange! But wait... look at how it's blending!"
Before/After Comparison Frame
Example Script: [Split screen showing before and during application]
Nikkie: "Can you see the difference? The side with the fork application actually has a really interesting texture. It's depositing the product in a way that's creating almost a stippled effect, which is actually quite nice for texture!"
[Zooms in to show detail]
4. Rehook Unit
Question Rehook Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie looking surprised at results]

[Dramatic music sting]
5. Content Segment 2 Unit
Step-by-Step Demo Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie with eyeshadow and scotch tape]
Nikkie: "Hack number three: using scotch tape as an eyeshadow shield and cut-crease guide. First, I'll place the tape like this, following my lower lash line upward. Then I'll apply this vibrant purple shadow right up to the edge of the tape."
[Demonstrates technique in detail]
Nikkie: "Now for the moment of truth - removing the tape!"

Reaction Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie's genuine reaction to results]
Nikkie: "Oh my god! Look at that line! It's so sharp you could cut someone with it! I did not expect it to be this clean. Usually when I try hacks like this, something goes terribly wrong."

Nikkie: "I'm actually obsessed with how this turned out!"
6. Content Segment 3 Unit
Common Pitfalls Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie demonstrating a hack gone wrong]
Nikkie: "Hack number four: using a credit card to apply contour. Now, I need to warn you - angle is everything with this hack. When I tried it like this [demonstrates incorrect angle], it created a harsh line that was impossible to blend. But when I adjusted to this angle [shows correct technique], it actually worked!"
[Shows side-by-side comparison]
Expert Tip Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie offering professional insight]
Nikkie: "Here's what I've learned from testing these hacks: they often work, but not exactly as shown in the videos. The key is to understand the principle behind the hack and then adapt it to your face shape and makeup style. For example, this technique works better with cream products than powders."
[Demonstrates modified version of hack]

Honest Assessment Frame
Example Script: [Nikkie giving final verdicts]
