Creating a custom storyboard tool with drag-and-drop functionality, resembling platforms like Miro or Milanote, involves several key components:

Skeletons: Containers or "shells" where content is organized.
Frames: Individual content elements that can be sequenced within Skeletons.
Tones and Filters: Overlays that add personality or emotional context to Frames or entire Skeletons.
Interactive Timeline: A user interface element that allows users to arrange and manage Frames within Skeletons, similar to video editing timelines.
Implementation Steps:

User Interface (UI) Design:

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Implement a system that allows users to drag Frames into Skeletons and rearrange them as needed. Libraries like React DnD or SortableJS can facilitate this.
Timeline Visualization: Create a visual timeline where Frames can be sequenced. Tools like Timeliner offer a simple JavaScript timeline library suitable for animation and prototyping.
Content Management:

Frames: Develop a system to create, edit, and store various types of content within Frames. This could include text, images, or other media.
Skeletons: Allow users to create and manage Skeletons that house Frames.
Tones and Filters:

Application: Enable users to apply Tones and Filters to individual Frames or entire Skeletons. This could involve overlay effects, color adjustments, or other stylistic modifications.
Interactive Elements:

Frame Editing: Implement functionality that allows users to click on a Frame to open a text note or detailed view for planning and content editing.
Technical Considerations:

Framework: Utilize a modern JavaScript framework like React to build a dynamic and responsive UI.
State Management: Implement state management to handle the dynamic interactions between Skeletons, Frames, and applied Tones/Filters.
Persistence: Ensure that user data is saved appropriately, possibly through local storage or a backend database, to maintain the state of the storyboard between sessions.
Existing Tools for Reference:

Storynator: A simple HTML5 collaborative storyboard editor with drag-and-drop and direct text editing capabilities. It allows users to write, load images, move elements, and filter content. GitHub Repository
Timeliner: A simple JavaScript timeline library for animation and prototyping. It provides a graphical interface to help create and prototype animations quickly. GitHub Repository
By leveraging these tools and frameworks, you can develop a customized storyboard application that aligns with your proprietary system, offering an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, timeline management, and the ability to apply tones and filters to your content.
