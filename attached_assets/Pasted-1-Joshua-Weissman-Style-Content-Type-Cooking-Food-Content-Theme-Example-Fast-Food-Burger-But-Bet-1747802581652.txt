Theme Example: "Fast Food Burger But Better"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Visual Hook Frame
Example Script: [Close-up shot of a perfectly seared burger patty being placed on a homemade brioche bun, juices dripping]
Joshua: "That right there is what a real burger should look like. Not that sad, flat thing they serve you at [Fast Food Chain]."
Challenge Setup Frame
Example Script: [Joshua standing in kitchen, holding fast food burger in one hand]
Joshua: "Today, we're taking this sad excuse for a burger and transforming it into something that will make your taste buds absolutely lose their minds. This is [Fast Food Chain] Burger... But Better!"
[Intro music and title card]
2. Intro Unit
Relatable Problem Frame
Example Script: [Joshua unwrapping and examining fast food burger with disappointed expression]
Joshua: "Look at this thing. Dry, overcooked patty. Wilted lettuce. A bun that's been squished into oblivion. And don't even get me started on this sauce that's basically just glorified mayo with food coloring. We deserve better than this, people!"
[Dramatic close-up of sad burger elements]
Promise of Value Frame
Example Script: [Joshua confidently addressing camera]
Joshua: "So here's what we're going to do. We're making everything from scratch - a perfect smash burger patty with a custom blend of beef, homemade brioche buns that are going to be absolutely luscious, quick-pickled onions for acidity, and a secret sauce that will make you slap your mama. This is going to be the burger of your dreams."
3. Content Delivery Unit
Step-by-Step Demo Frame
Example Script: [Joshua at counter with flour, eggs, butter for bun]
Joshua: "First, we're making our brioche buns. In a stand mixer, we're combining 500 grams of bread flour, 10 grams of salt, 80 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of instant yeast."
[Close-up of ingredients being measured precisely]
Joshua: "Now we're adding 200 milliliters of whole milk that I've warmed to exactly 95 degrees Fahrenheit, 2 eggs, and 80 grams of softened butter. We're going to mix this until it's smooth and elastic."
[Continues with detailed steps for each component]
Educational Frame
Example Script: [Joshua forming burger patties]
Joshua: "Now for the patties, I'm using a blend of 70% chuck and 30% brisket for the perfect fat content. You want around 20% fat for a juicy smash burger. And here's the key - don't overwork the meat! Just gently form it into balls. We're going for tender, not tough."
[Close-up of proper technique]
Joshua: "And we're not adding any seasoning to the mix. Just salt and pepper right before it hits the scorching hot cast iron. This creates the perfect Maillard reaction for maximum flavor."
Behind-the-Scenes Frame
Example Script: [Time-lapse of buns rising]
Joshua: "While our dough is doing its thing, I've already prepared our quick-pickled onions. These have been sitting for about 2 hours in a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. The acidity is going to cut through the richness of our burger perfectly."
[Shows pre-prepared components]
Joshua: "And I've also made our secret sauce, which is a combination of mayo, ketchup, pickle juice, paprika, garlic powder, and a touch of cayenne for heat. This is worlds better than whatever mystery sauce they're using."
4. Escalation Unit
Stakes Amplifier Frame
Example Script: [Joshua heating cast iron skillet until smoking]
Joshua: "Now comes the moment of truth. We need this skillet absolutely ripping hot. I'm talking 500+ degrees. If it's not hot enough, we won't get that beautiful crust that makes a smash burger so incredible."
[Dramatic shot of skillet with heat waves visible]
Joshua: "This is where most people fail. They get impatient or scared of the heat. But greatness requires commitment, people!"
Comparison Frame
Example Script: [Split screen showing fast food patty next to Joshua's patty cooking]
Joshua: "Look at the difference here. Their patty is pre-cooked, frozen, and reheated. Ours is fresh, perfectly seasoned, and getting an incredible sear that's developing hundreds of flavor compounds. It's not even a competition at this point."
[Close-up of his patty developing a dark crust]
Joshua: "That crust is what dreams are made of, people. That's what we're after!"
5. Reveal Unit
Big Reveal Frame
Example Script: [Joshua assembling final burger with dramatic music]
Joshua: "And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. Toasted brioche bun, secret sauce on the bottom, perfectly seared patty, melted American cheese, crisp lettuce, tomato, quick-pickled onions, more sauce, and the crown of our beautiful bun."
[Slow-motion shot of completed burger, steam rising]
Joshua: "Just look at that. Absolutely magnificent. A true work of art."
Taste Test Frame
Example Script: [Joshua taking a big bite, eyes widening]
Joshua: [Chewing, then looking directly at camera with serious expression]
Joshua: "Oh my... that is... ridiculous. The juiciness of that patty, the butteriness of the bun, the tang from the pickled onions, the richness of the sauce... it all comes together in perfect harmony."
[Takes another bite, making exaggerated pleasure sounds]
Joshua: "This isn't even in the same universe as the fast food version. This is what a burger should be."
6. Reflection Unit
Success Formula Frame
Example Script: [Joshua standing next to both burgers]
Joshua: "What makes this burger superior comes down to three things: quality ingredients, proper technique, and attention to detail. We didn't take shortcuts. We respected each component. And the result speaks for itself."
[Points to fast food burger]
Joshua: "This costs $4.99 and leaves you feeling empty inside."
[Points to homemade burger]
Joshua: "This costs about $3.50 per burger to make and will change your life."
One-Liner Wisdom Frame
Example Script: [Joshua with serious expression]
Joshua: "Remember, people - cooking is about transformation. Taking something ordinary and making it extraordinary. That's the power you have in your kitchen every single day."

2. lilsimsie Style
Content Type: Gaming/The Sims 4
Theme Example: "Building My Dream Tiny House in The Sims 4"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Visual Hook Frame
Example Script: [Quick montage of beautiful tiny house builds in The Sims 4]
Kayla: "Okay, so I may have a slight obsession with tiny houses in The Sims. They're just so cute and cozy and perfect and today we're building the ultimate tiny house that's actually functional for gameplay!"
[Zooms in on her face with exaggerated excited expression]
Challenge Setup Frame
Example Script: [Kayla in facecam with empty lot in Sims 4 visible]
Kayla: "So here's the challenge - we're going to build a fully functional tiny house on this 20x15 lot in Evergreen Harbor. It needs a kitchen, bathroom, living space, and at least one bedroom, but I also want it to be super cute and have a little garden. And we're going to try to keep it under 32 tiles to get all those tiny home benefits. This is going to be chaotic!"
2. Intro Unit
Relatable Problem Frame
Example Script: [Kayla looking frustrated at previous tiny house attempts]
Kayla: "I've tried building functional tiny houses before, and they always end up being either too cramped for actual gameplay or they're not actually tiny anymore. Like this one I made last month - it's cute, but my Sim kept getting the uncomfortable moodlet because they couldn't walk anywhere without bumping into things. It was a disaster!"
[Shows Sim struggling to navigate previous build]
Kayla: "And don't even get me started on trying to fit in a decent kitchen. Why do counters have to take up so much space?!"
Promise of Value Frame
Example Script: [Kayla with determined expression]
Kayla: "But today is going to be different! I've been researching tiny house layouts, and I think I've figured out some tricks to make this work. We're going to use platforms for different levels, Murphy beds to save space, and I found some amazing custom content that's going to make this place super cute while being actually playable. Let's get started!"
3. Content Journey Unit
Step-by-Step Demo Frame
Example Script: [Kayla working on the foundation of the house]
Kayla: "First, I'm starting with a 6x5 foundation for the main living area. I know that seems tiny, but trust me, we're going to make it work! I'm adding a little 3x4 bump-out on the side for the bathroom."
[Shows placement of walls and initial structure]
Kayla: "Now I'm going to add a platform here that's raised by one click - this is going to be our bedroom area, and we'll put the Murphy bed against this wall so it can fold up during the day and give us more space."
[Continues demonstrating build process]
Educational Frame
Example Script: [Kayla showing game mechanics]
Kayla: "Okay, so here's a little Sims 4 tip - if you use these half walls instead of full walls for the bathroom, it makes the space feel more open while still giving your Sim privacy. The game counts it as a room, but visually it doesn't cut off the space."
[Demonstrates wall height options]
Kayla: "And remember, tiny homes under 32 tiles get a 50% boost to Sim needs, which is actually super helpful for gameplay. Your Sims will be happier in a well-designed tiny home than in a mansion!"
Humor Frame
Example Script: [Kayla placing items in awkward spots]
Kayla: "I'm putting the fridge right next to the bed because nothing says 'sweet dreams' like the sound of your refrigerator running all night! I'm kidding, we're not doing that. Even I have standards... barely."
[Laughs at her own joke]
Kayla: "Although, midnight snacks would be super convenient. No, Kayla, focus! We're trying to make this functional, not cursed!"
4. Rehook Unit
Question Rehook Frame
Example Script: [Kayla pausing mid-build, looking concerned]
Kayla: "Wait, do you think we should go with the eco-friendly appliances or the more compact ones? The eco ones will fit the Evergreen Harbor vibe, but they take up more counter space... What would you do? I'm kind of leaning toward the compact ones even though they're not as cute."
[Looks indecisively between options]
Kayla: "This is the kind of decision that keeps me up at night, folks. The struggles of a Sims builder!"
Midway Shock Frame
Example Script: [Kayla accidentally deleting part of the build]
Kayla: "OH NO! I just deleted the entire bathroom! Why does this always happen to me?!"
[Exaggerated panic face]
Kayla: "It's fine, it's fine, we can fix this. This is why we have ctrl+z, folks. Crisis averted. Although, maybe the build would be better without a bathroom... No, that's definitely cursed building. We need the bathroom."
5. Reveal Unit
Big Reveal Frame
Example Script: [Camera panning around completed tiny house]
Kayla: "And here it is! Our completed tiny house! We managed to fit everything in just 31 tiles, so we get all those tiny home benefits. We have our Murphy bed that folds up into the wall, a compact kitchen with all the essentials, a cute little bathroom with a shower-tub combo, and even a small living area with a bookshelf and TV."
[Shows exterior with garden]
Kayla: "And look at this adorable garden outside! I used the eco footprint-friendly plants so our Sim can help keep Evergreen Harbor green while having fresh produce. I'm actually obsessed with how this turned out!"
Reaction Frame
Example Script: [Kayla with hands on cheeks, looking excited]
Kayla: "I think this might be my favorite tiny house I've ever built! It's actually functional, it's super cute, and I didn't have to sacrifice anything important. I'm literally so excited to play with this in my next Let's Play. I think my Rags to Riches Sim would love living here!"
[Zooms in on face]
Kayla: "I'm not even being dramatic right now, I'm genuinely so happy with how this turned out!"
6. Engagement Trigger Unit
Ask a Question Frame
Example Script: [Kayla looking directly at camera]
Kayla: "What do you think of our tiny house? Would you change anything about it? I'm thinking maybe the color scheme could use some work, but I'm kind of obsessed with the layout. Let me know your thoughts in the comments!"
[Points downward]
Kayla: "Also, do you prefer playing in tiny homes or big mansions in The Sims? I go back and forth, but tiny homes are winning me over lately."
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Kayla waving]
Kayla: "If you enjoyed this build, please hit that like button! It really helps the channel. And if you want to see me actually play in this tiny house, make sure you're subscribed and have notifications turned on so you don't miss the Let's Play. Also, I stream on Twitch four times a week if you want to see more chaotic building in real-time!"
[Smiles and waves]
Kayla: "Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one! Bye!"
Production Notes:
Bright, colorful facecam in corner
Enthusiastic, fast-paced delivery
Frequent use of zooms on facecam for emphasis
Casual, conversational tone
Self-deprecating humor
Exaggerated reactions
Split between building focus and personality focus

Authentic moments of frustration or mistakes kept in
Frequent use of Sims-specific terminology
3. Danny Maude Style
Content Type: Golf Instruction
Theme Example: "Fix Your Slice FOREVER With This Simple Technique"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Problem Statement Frame
Example Script: [Danny on golf course, demonstrating a severe slice]
Danny: "If you're struggling with a slice that sends your ball sailing into the trees on the right, you're not alone. This is the number one problem I see with amateur golfers, and it can be incredibly frustrating."
[Shows multiple amateur golfers hitting slices]
Danny: "But what if I told you there's a simple technique that could fix your slice forever?"
Promise of Solution Frame
Example Script: [Danny hitting a perfect draw]
Danny: "In today's video, I'm going to share a breakthrough approach that has helped thousands of my students eliminate their slice and start hitting beautiful draws like this one. And the best part? It doesn't require changing your entire swing or hours of practice."
[Ball flies perfectly down the fairway with slight draw]
Danny: "Stay with me, because this could be the most important golf tip you ever receive."
2. Intro Unit
Credibility Establishment Frame
Example Script: [Danny speaking directly to camera]
Danny: "I've been teaching golf for over 20 years, and in that time, I've helped players of all levels fix their slice. What I've discovered is that most instructors make this far too complicated. They focus on positions and angles that are difficult to replicate. But I've developed a simple, feel-based approach that works for everyone, regardless of age, flexibility, or athletic ability."
[Brief montage of Danny teaching diverse students]
Danny: "This technique has worked for thousands of my students, and I'm confident it will work for you too."
Relatable Problem Frame
Example Script: [Danny demonstrating common mistakes]
Danny: "Here's what typically happens. You set up to the ball, feeling confident. You make your backswing, and as you come down, something goes wrong. The clubface stays open, your path moves out-to-in, and suddenly your ball is sailing off to the right, losing distance and accuracy."
[Shows slow-motion of problematic swing]
Danny: "You've probably been told to strengthen your grip, to 'release' the club more, or to change your swing path. And if you're like most golfers, these tips might work briefly but then the slice returns. It's maddening, isn't it?"
3. Content Delivery Unit
Conceptual Explanation Frame
Example Script: [Danny with whiteboard showing swing path diagrams]
Danny: "To understand why you slice, we need to understand two key factors: clubface and path. A slice happens when your clubface is open relative to your swing path at impact. Most golfers try to fix this by manipulating their hands, but that's actually making things worse."
[Shows diagram of swing path and clubface angles]
Danny: "The real solution isn't in your hands - it's in how you use your body. When your body moves correctly, the club naturally falls into the right position. It's about working with physics, not against it."
Visual Demonstration Frame
Example Script: [Danny demonstrating the technique in slow motion]
Danny: "Here's the technique. Instead of focusing on your hands, I want you to feel like your trail shoulder is moving down and through toward the target as you start your downswing. Like this."
[Shows movement several times from different angles]
Danny: "Notice how when I do this, my arms naturally drop into the right slot, the clubface squares up, and my path naturally shifts more in-to-out. I'm not manipulating anything with my hands - it's all coming from this shoulder movement."
Comparison Frame
Example Script: [Split screen showing incorrect vs. correct technique]
Danny: "Let's compare. On the left is the typical slice motion, where the upper body stalls and the arms throw out away from the body. See how that opens the clubface and creates that out-to-in path?"
[Points to left screen]
Danny: "Now look at our new technique on the right. The shoulder moves down and through, the arms stay connected to the body, and everything syncs up perfectly at impact. It's a completely different result from one simple change in feel."
4. Practical Application Unit
Step-by-Step Instruction Frame
Example Script: [Danny breaking down the drill]
Danny: "Let's break this down into a simple drill you can practice anywhere. Start without a club, and place your trail hand on your lead shoulder. Now, make a backswing, and as you start down, feel your trail shoulder moving down and toward the target."
[Demonstrates slowly]
Danny: "Once you've got that feeling, grab a club and make some slow-motion swings, focusing only on that shoulder movement. Don't worry about hitting the ball yet - just groove this new movement pattern."
Drill Introduction Frame
Example Script: [Danny at practice area]
Danny: "Here's a fantastic drill to reinforce this movement. Take an alignment stick and place it along your trail shoulder, tucking it under your arm. Now, make swings focusing on pointing that stick toward the target as you come through impact."
[Demonstrates drill]
Danny: "If you're doing it correctly, the stick will point at the target after impact. If you're reverting to your slice pattern, the stick will point well right of target. This immediate feedback is invaluable."
Common Mistake Warning Frame
Example Script: [Danny showing errors to avoid]
Danny: "Now, there are two common mistakes I see when people try this technique. First, they confuse moving the shoulder down and through with simply dipping the shoulder down. That actually makes things worse."
[Shows incorrect movement]
Danny: "The second mistake is trying to force the new movement while still consciously manipulating the hands. You need to trust that the correct hand action will happen naturally when your body moves correctly. Let go of those hand-focused swing thoughts."
5. Proof Unit
Student Success Frame
Example Script: [Video of student before and after]
Danny: "Here's John, who came to me with a severe slice. He'd been struggling with it for years despite taking numerous lessons."
[Shows John's before swing and slice]
Danny: "After just 30 minutes of working on this shoulder movement, look at the difference."
[Shows John's improved swing and straight ball flight]
Danny: "He's not thinking about his hands or the clubface - he's simply focused on that shoulder movement, and everything else falls into place."
Results Validation Frame
Example Script: [Danny with TrackMan data]
Danny: "Let's look at some data to validate this. On the left are the numbers from a typical slice: 3 degrees open clubface, 5 degrees out-to-in path, resulting in 15 yards of slice curve and significant distance loss."
[Shows before data]
Danny: "Now look at the same golfer using our shoulder technique: clubface only 1 degree open, path 1 degree in-to-out, resulting in a slight draw and 23 yards of additional carry distance. The numbers don't lie!"
6. Reflection Unit
Key Takeaway Frame
Example Script: [Danny on golf course]
Danny: "The key takeaway here is that fixing your slice isn't about manipulating your hands or memorizing complex positions. It's about changing how your body moves through the swing, specifically that trail shoulder motion. When you get this right, everything else tends to fall into place naturally."
[Hits perfect draw down fairway]
Danny: "This is why this technique works for golfers of all levels - it's based on a natural athletic motion rather than technical positions."
Encouragement Frame
Example Script: [Danny speaking directly to camera]
Danny: "Now, I want to be clear - this isn't an overnight miracle. You'll need to practice this new movement to override your old pattern. But unlike other swing changes that can take months, most of my students see dramatic improvements within their first practice session."
[Warm, encouraging expression]
Danny: "Stick with it, be patient with yourself, and trust the process. I promise you, if you focus on this shoulder movement and practice the drills I've shown you, you will see your slice start to disappear and your ball flight become more consistent."
7. Outro Unit
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Danny on course, relaxed posture]
Danny: "If you found this helpful, please give the video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel for more simple, effective golf tips. I release new videos every week designed to help you play better golf with less frustration."
[Points to subscription button]
Danny: "And let me know in the comments if this shoulder movement helps your slice. I read every comment and love hearing your success stories."
Additional Resource Frame
Example Script: [Danny holding phone]
Danny: "For more detailed instruction on fixing your slice, I've created a comprehensive training program that takes you through this process step by step. You'll find the link in the description below. And don't forget to download my free ebook '5 Steps to Consistent Golf' from my website."
[Shows website briefly]
Danny: "Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!"
Production Notes:
Clear, well-lit golf course or practice area setting
Multiple camera angles of swing demonstrations
Slow-motion footage with graphics highlighting key movements
Friendly, encouraging tone throughout
British accent adds distinctive character
Simple, non-technical language
Before/after comparisons
TrackMan or similar technology for data validation
Authentic enthusiasm when explaining concepts
Emphasis on "feel" rather than technical positions
4. Graham Stephan Style
Content Type: Personal Finance/Real Estate
Theme Example: "How I Built a 7-Figure Real Estate Portfolio with No Money Down"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Shocking Statement Frame
Example Script: [Graham sitting in minimalist room, direct to camera]
Graham: "Last year, I added 12 rental properties to my portfolio without using any of my own money for down payments. These properties now generate over $18,000 in monthly cash flow, and I'm going to show you exactly how I did it."
[Quick zoom in]
Graham: "And no, this isn't some get-rich-quick scheme or shady strategy. This is a legitimate approach that anyone can use if they're willing to put in the work."
Problem Identification Frame
Example Script: [Graham with serious expression]
Graham: "The biggest obstacle preventing most people from investing in real estate is the down payment. You're told you need 20-25% down, which means $50,000 to $100,000 just to buy a single property. For most people, that's completely unrealistic."
[Shows calculator with down payment calculations]
Graham: "But what if I told you there are multiple ways to acquire properties with little to no money down, completely legally and ethically? That changes everything."
2. Intro Unit
Credibility Establishment Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing property documents]
Graham: "Before I dive in, let me show you that this is real. Here are the closing documents for the 12 properties I acquired last year. I now own 37 rental units total, which I've built up over the past 10 years starting when I was just 18 years old working as a real estate agent making $16,000 a year."
[Shows property portfolio spreadsheet]
Graham: "I'm not sharing this to brag, but to show you that these strategies actually work in the real world. I've used every technique I'm about to share personally."
Contrarian Perspective Frame
Example Script: [Graham with skeptical expression]
Graham: "Now, you've probably heard 'experts' say that no-money-down deals don't exist anymore, or that they're all scams. That's completely false. While it was easier during the 2008 housing crash, there are still multiple ways to do this in today's market."
[Shakes head]
Graham: "The truth is, most real estate 'gurus' don't teach these methods because they're not flashy or exciting. They require work, creativity, and persistence. But they absolutely still work, and I'm living proof of that."
3. Content Delivery Unit
Data-Driven Explanation Frame
Example Script: [Graham with charts showing financing options]
Graham: "Let's look at the data. In 2023, 72% of investment properties were purchased with some form of creative financing. Of the deals I personally did last year, 5 were seller financing, 4 were BRRRR method, and 3 were partnership deals."
[Shows pie chart of financing methods]
Graham: "The average interest rate I negotiated was 5.8%, which is 1.2% below market rates at the time. And my average cash-on-cash return is 22%, which is significantly higher than most stock market investments."
Step-by-Step Strategy Frame
Example Script: [Graham with whiteboard]
Graham: "Strategy number one: Seller financing. This is where the seller acts as the bank. Instead of getting a mortgage, you make payments directly to the seller. Here's exactly how I approach this:"
[Writes on whiteboard]
Graham: "Step 1: Find motivated sellers who own their properties free and clear. You can find these through direct mail, driving for dollars, or working with specialized real estate agents."
Graham: "Step 2: Make an offer that solves their problem. Maybe they want monthly income, maybe they want to avoid capital gains tax, or maybe they just don't want the hassle of selling traditionally."
Graham: "Step 3: Structure a win-win deal. I typically offer slightly above market value in exchange for 0-5% down, a 30-year amortization, and a 5-7 year balloon payment."
[Continues with detailed steps]
Transparency Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing actual deal numbers]
Graham: "Let me show you the exact numbers from one of my recent deals. This duplex was listed for $275,000. The seller was retiring and moving to Florida. I offered $285,000 with $5,000 down, 6% interest, and a 5-year balloon."
[Shows spreadsheet with calculations]
Graham: "My monthly payment is $1,680. The property rents for $1,200 per unit, so $2,400 total. After expenses, I'm cash flowing about $400 per month. And I only had to bring $5,000 to closing, plus about $3,000 in closing costs and inspections."
Graham: "I'm being completely transparent here - this isn't a home run deal, but it's solid. And most importantly, I control a $285,000 asset with just $8,000 out of pocket."
4. Practical Application Unit
Real-World Example Frame
Example Script: [Graham walking through property]
Graham: "This is one of the properties I acquired last year using the BRRRR method - Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. It was a foreclosure that needed significant work."
[Shows before pictures]
Graham: "I purchased it for $140,000 using a hard money loan. Put about $35,000 into renovations. After repairs, it appraised for $230,000. I refinanced with a conventional loan at 75% LTV, which gave me about $172,500. I paid off the hard money loan and renovation costs, and walked away from closing with about $2,500 in my pocket."
[Shows current state of property]
Graham: "So I literally got paid to acquire this property, and it cash flows $650 per month. This is what I mean by creative financing."
Tool/Resource Recommendation Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing phone apps]
Graham: "Here are the exact tools I use to find and analyze these deals. First, PropStream for finding motivated sellers - it costs $99 a month but is worth every penny. Second, DealCheck for analyzing deals in seconds. And third, Bigger Pockets calculators for double-checking my numbers."
[Shows each app briefly]
Graham: "I'll link all of these in the description below. None of these are sponsored, by the way. These are just the tools I personally use every day."
Common Mistake Warning Frame
Example Script: [Graham with cautionary expression]
Graham: "Now, let me warn you about the three biggest mistakes I see people make with creative financing. First, not doing proper due diligence. Just because you're not putting much money down doesn't mean you can skip inspections or title searches."
[Counts on fingers]
Graham: "Second, overestimating rental income. Always use conservative estimates and account for vacancies and repairs."
Graham: "And third, not having an exit strategy for balloon payments. You need to know exactly how you'll handle that payment when it comes due, whether through refinancing, selling, or other means."
5. Proof Unit
Personal Results Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing portfolio growth chart]
Graham: "Here's how my portfolio has grown using these strategies. I started with one owner-occupied duplex in 2012. By 2015, I had 5 units. By 2020, I had 25 units. And now I'm at 37 units with a portfolio value of approximately $7.2 million."
[Shows growth chart]
Graham: "My total cash invested across all properties is about $280,000, which means I've leveraged my capital at a ratio of about 25:1. This is the power of creative financing when done responsibly."
Case Study Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing student success]
Graham: "I want to share a quick case study of my student Michael, who implemented these exact strategies. He was a high school teacher with about $15,000 saved. Within 18 months, he acquired 4 properties using a combination of house hacking, seller financing, and partnerships."
[Shows Michael's properties]
Graham: "He now has passive income of about $2,500 per month, which has allowed him to go part-time as a teacher and spend more time with his family. And he did this in a high-cost market that everyone said was 'impossible' to invest in."
6. Reflection Unit
Key Principle Frame
Example Script: [Graham in thoughtful pose]
Graham: "The key principle to remember is that real estate investing isn't about the money you have - it's about the value you can create and the problems you can solve. When you focus on finding win-win solutions for sellers and adding value to properties, the financing becomes secondary."
[Serious expression]
Graham: "This isn't about 'getting something for nothing.' It's about leveraging your knowledge, skills, and creativity instead of just your cash. That's a completely different mindset from how most people approach investing."
Long-Term Impact Frame
Example Script: [Graham showing retirement calculator]
Graham: "Let's talk about the long-term impact of building a portfolio this way. If you acquire just one property per year for 10 years, with each property cash flowing $300 per month, that's $36,000 per year in passive income by year 10."
[Shows compound growth chart]
Graham: "But it gets better. As rents increase with inflation and you pay down the mortgages, that same portfolio might generate $60,000 to $80,000 per year by year 20. And that's not even counting the equity growth, which could easily be over $1 million."
Graham: "This is how average people build extraordinary wealth over time."
7. Outro Unit
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Graham energetic]
Graham: "If you found this valuable, please smash that like button - it really helps the channel. And if you're new here, consider subscribing for more real estate and financial content every week."
[Points down]
Graham: "I've created a free PDF guide that goes into more detail on each of these strategies, with sample scripts for negotiating with sellers. You can download it at the link in the description."
Community Building Frame
Example Script: [Graham relaxed, friendly]
Graham: "Let me know in the comments which of these strategies you find most interesting or if you have questions about implementing them. I read every comment and try to respond to as many as I can."
[Smiles]
Graham: "Also, share your own creative financing success stories if you have them. This community is all about learning from each other, and your experience might be exactly what someone else needs to hear."
Graham: "Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one!"

5. Ryan Trahan Style
Content Type: Challenge/Entertainment
Theme Example: "I Survived on $1 for 7 Days in New York City"
Skeleton & Frame Breakdown:
1. Hook Unit
Challenge Statement Frame
Example Script: [Ryan standing in Times Square with $1 bill]
Ryan: "I'm in the most expensive city in America with only one dollar to my name. For the next seven days, I'll have to find a way to eat, sleep, and survive using nothing but this single dollar and my wits."
[Holds up dollar to camera]
Ryan: "No credit cards, no help from friends, just pure survival and hustle in the concrete jungle."
Stakes Establishment Frame
Example Script: [Ryan looking at expensive NYC prices]
Ryan: "The average hotel room here costs $350 per night. A cheap meal is around $15. And I have seven days to survive on less money than it costs to ride the subway. If I fail, I've committed to donating $10,000 to charity - which would be great for them, but not so great for my bank account."
[Shows map of NYC]
Ryan: "To make this even harder, I have to visit all five boroughs during the week. This is either going to be the greatest challenge I've ever completed or a complete disaster."
2. Intro Unit
Hero's Journey Setup Frame
Example Script: [Ryan walking through crowded street]
Ryan: "I've done survival challenges before, but New York City is a different beast entirely. It's expensive, fast-paced, and not exactly known for its hospitality to broke people. But I believe with creativity and persistence, it's possible to not just survive, but maybe even thrive here."
[Determined expression]
Ryan: "My strategy is simple: turn this one dollar into more money through whatever legal means necessary, then use that to survive the week. It's entrepreneurship at its most basic level."
Obstacle Preview Frame
Example Script: [Ryan looking at weather forecast showing rain]
Ryan: "Of course, there are a few complications. First, it's supposed to rain for three days this week, and I don't have rain gear. Second, I have no idea where I'm sleeping tonight. And third, I haven't eaten since yesterday, so I'm already starting hungry."
[Stomach growls audibly]
Ryan: "This might be the toughest challenge I've ever attempted, but I'm determined to make it work. Let's get started!"
3. Journey Unit
Milestone Achievement Frame
Example Script: [Ryan excitedly holding up $5]
Ryan: "Guys, I can't believe this worked! I found a discarded water bottle, cleaned it up, filled it with tap water from a public bathroom, and sold it to a tourist for $5! That's a 500% return on my investment in just two hours!"
[Victory dance]
Ryan: "This changes everything. Now I can actually buy some food and start thinking about where to sleep tonight. First milestone achieved: I'm no longer broke!"
Unexpected Obstacle Frame
Example Script: [Ryan looking distressed in the rain]
Ryan: "So, slight problem. Remember that rain I mentioned? It started pouring about an hour earlier than forecast, and I got completely soaked. Even worse, the cheap phone charger I bought stopped working when it got wet, so my phone is at 12% with no way to charge it."
[Shows dead charger]
Ryan: "This is a major setback because I was planning to use my phone to find free places to stay and cheap food options. I need to find a solution fast, or this challenge is going to get a lot harder."
Character Introduction Frame
Example Script: [Ryan talking with street vendor]
Ryan: "This is Mohammed. He runs this halal food cart, and when I explained my challenge, he offered me a deal: if I help him break down his cart tonight, he'll give me dinner and let me charge my phone."
[Mohammed waves to camera]
Mohammed: "I did a similar challenge when I first came to America. It's hard, but not impossible."
Ryan: "Meeting people like Mohammed is what makes these challenges so special. Complete strangers becoming allies in the most unexpected ways."
4. Tension Unit
Conflict Escalation Frame
Example Script: [Ryan looking exhausted on day 4]
Ryan: "It's day four, and things are getting tough. I've slept on park benches for three nights, I've been living on dollar pizza slices, and I'm exhausted from walking everywhere to save money. To make matters worse, I still need to find a way to get to Staten Island, and the ferry costs $2.75 each way."
[Shows blistered feet]
Ryan: "I've made about $27 so far through various hustles, but I'm having to spend most of it on food. The physical and mental fatigue is really starting to catch up with me."
Emotional Response Frame
Example Script: [Ryan sitting alone at night, looking reflective]
Ryan: "I have to be honest, last night was really difficult. Sleeping outside when you're exhausted and hungry makes you question a lot of things. It's given me a new perspective on what homeless people go through every day, not just for a week, but indefinitely."
[Emotional moment]
Ryan: "I'm doing this by choice, and I know it ends in a few days. Many people don't have that luxury. It's humbling and heartbreaking at the same time."
Suspense Building Frame
Example Script: [Ryan rushing through subway station]
Ryan: "It's day six, and I'm in a race against time. I have exactly $4.83 left, and I need to somehow get to Queens and back before the community kitchen closes at 7 PM, or I won't eat tonight. The subway would cost me almost all my remaining money, so I'm trying to find another way."
[Shows clock: 5:47 PM]
Ryan: "I just met a delivery cyclist who said he might be able to help, but he's not sure. Everything hinges on whether he shows up in the next five minutes. This is going to be incredibly close."
5. Resolution Unit
Challenge Completion Frame
Example Script: [Ryan back in Times Square, looking tired but triumphant]
Ryan: "Day seven, final hour. Against all odds, I did it! I survived a full week in New York City starting with just one dollar. I visited all five boroughs, I never went hungry for a full day, and I even managed to shower three times thanks to some incredibly kind people."
[Shows map with all boroughs checked off]
Ryan: "In total, I turned my one dollar into $42.17 through various side hustles. I spent $39.86 on food, transportation, and a few essentials, leaving me with $2.31 - more than twice what I started with!"
Reflection Frame
Example Script: [Ryan sitting on park bench]
Ryan: "This challenge taught me so much more than I expected. Yes, it showed that with creativity and hustle, you can survive on very little. But more importantly, it showed me the incredible kindness of strangers and the resilience of the human spirit."
[Thoughtful expression]
Ryan: "I also experienced firsthand how exhausting poverty can be. Every decision becomes stressful when resources are scarce. It's not just physically draining, but mentally and emotionally draining too."
6. Meaning Unit
Broader Message Frame
Example Script: [Ryan walking through city at sunset]
Ryan: "Beyond the challenge itself, I hope this video helps us all appreciate what we have a little more. We take so many things for granted - a warm bed, easy access to food, the ability to travel without counting every penny."
[Pans to people walking by]
Ryan: "And maybe it also shows that many of the limitations we place on ourselves are just in our minds. With creativity and persistence, we can overcome seemingly impossible obstacles."
Gratitude Frame
Example Script: [Ryan smiling at camera]
Ryan: "I want to give a massive thank you to everyone who helped me during this week - Mohammed at the halal cart, Maria who let me shower at her gym, the community kitchen volunteers, and so many others. You turned what could have been a miserable experience into an adventure I'll never forget."
[Shows photos of people who helped]
Ryan: "And of course, thank you to you watching this. Your support allows me to do these crazy challenges and hopefully provide some entertainment and inspiration along the way."
7. Outro Unit
Next Adventure Tease Frame
Example Script: [Ryan with mysterious expression]
Ryan: "Now that I've conquered New York with $1, what should the next challenge be? I'm thinking something even more extreme, possibly involving a different country or a much longer timeframe. Let me know your ideas in the comments!"
[Raises eyebrows suggestively]
Ryan: "Whatever it is, I promise it will be bigger, crazier, and even more entertaining than this one."
Call-to-Action Frame
Example Script: [Ryan energetic]
Ryan: "If you enjoyed watching me struggle for seven days, please hit that like button! It really helps the channel. And if you're new here, subscribe for more challenges, experiments, and adventures every week."
[Points down]
Ryan: "Also, I'm donating $10,000 to the New York City Food Bank anyway, even though I completed the challenge. If you'd like to contribute as well, there's a link in the description."
Ryan: "Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!"
