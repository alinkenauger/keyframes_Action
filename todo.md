# User API Key Management Implementation

## Completed Tasks âœ“

### Database & Backend
- [x] Create database schema for user API keys with encryption support
- [x] Create EncryptionService for secure API key storage
- [x] Add API endpoints for CRUD operations on user API keys
- [x] Implement API key validation endpoint
- [x] Update AI routes to use user's API key with fallback to server key

### Frontend
- [x] Create ApiKeyManager component with full functionality
- [x] Add Profile page with tabbed interface
- [x] Integrate API key management into Profile page
- [x] Add route and navigation to Profile page
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut (g p) for Profile navigation

## Review

### Summary of Implementation

Successfully implemented a complete user API key management system that allows users to add their own OpenAI API keys:

1. **Security First**
   - API keys are encrypted using AES-256-CBC before storage
   - Keys are masked in the UI (showing only first and last 4 characters)
   - Validation ensures keys work before saving

2. **Backend Architecture**
   - RESTful API endpoints at `/api/user/api-keys`
   - Support for multiple providers (OpenAI implemented, others ready to add)
   - Automatic tracking of last used timestamp
   - User ownership verification on all operations

3. **Frontend Experience**
   - Clean, intuitive UI in the Profile page under API Keys tab
   - Real-time validation with clear feedback
   - Toggle keys active/inactive without deletion
   - Shows last used timestamp for usage tracking

4. **AI Integration**
   - All AI endpoints now check for user's API key first
   - Seamless fallback to server key if user hasn't configured their own
   - Error messages guide users to add their key when needed
   - Usage tracking updates lastUsed field automatically

### Technical Details

- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC with random IV for each key
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API**: Express with TypeScript and Zod validation
- **UI**: React with shadcn/ui components
- **Auth**: JWT-based authentication with middleware protection

### Next Steps

1. Run `npm run db:push` when PostgreSQL is running to create the table
2. Test the complete flow with a running database
3. Consider adding:
   - Support for Anthropic and other AI providers
   - Usage statistics and cost tracking
   - API key usage limits
   - Export/import functionality for backup

The implementation follows the project's principle of simplicity while providing a secure and user-friendly way for users to manage their own API keys.
