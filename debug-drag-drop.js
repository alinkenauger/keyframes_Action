=== Drag and Drop Debug Guide ===

To debug the drag and drop issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any errors when trying to drag
   - Check if drag events are firing

2. **Test Each Feature**:
   
   A. Test Frame Movement:
      - Click and hold on a frame card
      - Drag it to another position in the same column
      - Drag it to a different column
      - Expected: Green highlight on target column
   
   B. Test Unit/Column Movement:
      - Hover over a column to see the drag handle (3 horizontal lines)
      - Click and hold the drag handle
      - Try to drag the column left or right
      - Expected: Column should move to new position
   
   C. Test Column Resizing:
      - Look for the resize handle on the right edge of each column
      - Click and drag the handle left/right
      - Expected: Column width should change

3. **Common Issues**:
   
   - If drag handle doesn't appear:
     * Check if hovering shows the handle
     * Handle should be on the left side of column header
   
   - If dragging doesn't start:
     * Need to move mouse 15px before drag activates
     * Try clicking and moving more deliberately
   
   - If columns won't reorder:
     * Check browser console for errors
     * Verify you're dragging the handle, not the column content

4. **Quick Fixes to Try**:
   
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try in incognito/private mode
   - Check if any browser extensions are interfering

5. **Report Back**:
   
   When reporting issues, please note:
   - Which browser you're using
   - What exactly happens when you try to drag
   - Any console errors
   - Whether frame dragging works but column dragging doesn't

=== Additional Debug Steps ===

In the browser console, you can run:

// Check if drag and drop library is loaded
console.log(typeof window['@dnd-kit/core'] !== 'undefined' ? 'DnD Kit loaded' : 'DnD Kit NOT loaded');

// Check for drag handles
document.querySelectorAll('[draggable="true"]').length

// Check for sortable contexts
document.querySelectorAll('[data-dnd-auto-scroll-container]').length
`);
